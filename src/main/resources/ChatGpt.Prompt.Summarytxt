The first few prompt I send to ChatGPT and its response is as follow

Me: I am going to send java code for you to analysis
Chatgpt: Sure, I'd be happy to analyze your Java code. Please share it with me and let me know if you have any specific questions or concerns about it.
Me: The following GifSequenceWriter creates a GIF image from multiple images.
Chatgpt: I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you are asking. Can you provide the Java code for me to analyze?
Me : <Copy the class code GifSequenceWriter code from https://memorynotfound.com/generate-gif-image-java-delay-infinite-loop-example/>
Chatgpt: This Java code defines a class called GifSequenceWriter that creates a GIF animation from multiple images. .....
Me: Use the given GifSequenceWriter use and modify it to generate animated GIF
    The font should be Calbri of font size 133.
    The font color should be RBG 0,176,80.
    The background color of the gif should be white.
    The Gif should be of height 120 pixel, And there is 10 pixel bottom margin for the GIF.
    For each frame of the Gif, read from a text file of name input.txt.
    Each line of input.txt corresponds to one frame of the animated GIF.
    Each frame will display for 0.5 second in the animated GIF.
Chatgpt: To use the given GifSequenceWriter to generate an animated GIF with the specified requirements, you can modify the main method of your Java program as follows:
         <code generated by Chatgpt>

The initial code by Chatgpt basically works.

Summary of subsequent chat (full chat log is in ChatGpt.ChatLog.pdf, TLDR;) are on
a) Fixing syntax error and run time error
b) How to smooth out rough font edges (anti-aliasing)
c) Change code to read frame from a file specified by user
d) Change code to set output file same file name as input file
e) Change code to allow user to specify delay between frames
